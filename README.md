# Virtual-suspension  

 ![Robots are balancing in webots.](https://github.com/JameScottX/Virtual-suspension/blob/master/image/show.jpg)  

Virtual suspension model keeps balance by feet point contact.  
Simulation experiments on balance keeping are performed for single-leg robot vertical standing, quadruped robot diagonal standing and biped robot parallel standing cases.  

The project is the total work of the paper: [Standing balance maintenance by virtual suspension model control for legged robot](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1687814020954975). You can cite:
